	Hello! Welcome to MishMash. What is MishMash? MishMash is a game that turns the people in your Google+ circles into different challenges. I invite you to try one of the mini-games found below!
</span>

<span id="msg-picture" class="hidden">
	So you think you're familiar with the faces of the people in your circles? Come and try your face-recognition skill here! Random people will be chosen, and their names will be swapped with each other. Your task is to correctly match each person's picture to his or her name. Watch out though, you only have a limited number of attempts!
</span>

<span id="msg-search" class="hidden">
	Do you love word search games? Perfect! This is the traditional word search puzzle, but with a social twist. The words which you will be searching for are all randomly chosen names of people from your circles. There is a time limit, so you need to be quick!
</span>

<span id="msg-scramble" class="hidden">
	In a limited amount of time, can you figure out which person from your circles has had his or her name scrambled? I bet you can't!
